You have three constants in life.

### Life is hard

Yes it is. Nobody will give you the really important things. You need to go get it. You need to earn it yourself.  The best and most satisfying goals achieved are done through blood, sweat, and tears. 

### Everyone has Strength  

Black, White, Asian, Male, Female. We all have the drive within us. We all have strength and power to make change in life. Everything is within your grasp.  You just need to focus and figure it out.  There are no excuses. None. 

### Blame is negative energy

When you blame someone for your actions you give your power away. By taking the blame and thereby taking the responsibility to fix it and learning from your mistakes you are gaining your power.  We all make mistakes in life.  Life is hard *(read above), you are supposed to climb that mountain. You are supposed to screw up. You get back up and you do it again until you get it right. You have the power to fix it, to learn from it, to make the world a better place.  

There are no excuses. There is no blame on others if it is on you.  Own it.  Stop the blame game. Take your power back.
