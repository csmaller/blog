description: When someone comes into your life that can change your entire
  paradigm, you better pay attention.

You know that moment when it's darkest before dawn?  When you give up on trying to make things happen and stop trying to swim upstream?  When you hit rock bottom?  For addicts it's the realization that you *can* change.  

*You* have the power in you and the universe is just waiting patiently for *you* to make the decision.  

I have been trying to shake things up. I got a haircut by a professional and paid a little bit more than the Super Cuts $20 buzz or the barber.  I went see my friend Raven whom I've known for years.  She is going through her own midlife renaissance.  She discovered she is gay and found her soulmate, got yoga certified and her business is doing really well. She is very passionate about her hairstyling.  

I usually go in every few months and say  "go nuts, just do whatever you think."  Sometimes she colors it, sometimes she will buzz the sides and let the top grow out.  I can't believe as a part time entertainer I got on stage with that boring SuperCuts hair for so long.  I had to shake off the macho bullshit of years of social norms. 

I went in on Friday, February 19th. 

For all you astrology buffs out there this day is significant because Feb 19th is when the sun enters Pisces season from Aquarius.  Pisces season is all about surrender and acceptance, and encourages trusting divine intelligence.  It's a huge shift from the mind to the heart. It's also a time for closure and culmination. 

I was feeling down:  overwhelmed with life and tired.  She whipped out the sound bowl while her assistant washed my hair.  It vibrated my soul and I instantly become receptive.  

While I was resonating and soaking wet she nonchalantly says, "oh you know what, I have this friend I want you to meet."  

She stops and thinks for a second.

"Oh my God why haven't I thought of this! You two would be perfect together!  She snowboards every day, she is self aware, she is beautiful and smart and kind!"

I am sort of half listening. I have done these set ups before. I think we all have, but I love my friend's energy and don't want to hurt her feelings.  I just went on another boring date a few nights before.  Hopes dashed once again.  She frantically pulls up her Instagram and I see a flash of blonde and a big smile.  

"Ok sure take some pics of me and maybe send it over to her and we will see what happens." I say, and then I put it out of my mind.  Better to placate my lesbian hairdresser with sharp scissors in her hand than to say "No, I'm not looking and not interested right now but thanks."

Always be open. Always be receptive. Always be willing to try something new and say YES. 

Later that day another very pretty blonde started following me on IG. I saw she is friends with Raven and I assumed she was my gal.  I stalked her IG and see she's a cheer coach and I didn't see any pics of snowboarding or mountain biking and wasn't the person I thought.  I chalked it up to another failed connection by a well-meaning friend playing Cupid.

Two days later I get a message : " Hey Corey! Raven said you were begging for my number."

Whoa, wait what?  This wasn't the same person.  

Witty banter ensued. This person on the other end of my texts was smart and quick and witty and playful.  I found the right person on IG.  

The Universe sighed. 

We agreed to meet and go snowboarding together.  I planned the tickets and that Sunday I was to meet her for the first time.  A blind date on a mountain together all day. Talk about risking it.  If it sucks we are stuck together.  Live without a net.  I've done this before:  Past scars and failed dates. Boring snowboarder girls or ones who lied about their ability on a mountain can make a day on the slopes very painful. I pushed all of it out of my head. Stay positive, clean the slate. 

I drank a ton of coffee and bought some bagels.  Despite her beauty and obvious love for her two beautiful kids, her athleticism and self awareness I was still hesitant to open up. I was still pessimistic.  

The Universe sighed again, louder.

\-------------------------

I pulled into her driveway a bit late. I knocked on the door and she answered with this immediate energy. 

First impressions do not lie and the rawness of our first meeting will stay with me forever.  Do not ignore your instincts and your gut.  

She was making coffee and invited me into her kitchen and her world.  I'm taken aback by how relaxed and easy it is yet my soul is screaming at me. Bells are going off in my head.  Pay attention!   

I tried to remain calm. Our gaze met and I noticed she had the most mesmerizing, clear eyes.  I was overwhelmed with her pictures of her children, the love I saw all around, the attention to it, her little world she just nonchalantly let a strange man into.  I tried to play it cool. Do not lose it man. Don't blow it. Don't say the wrong thing. 

I think anyone in the history of love has that moment when they meet someone that shakes their foundations.  Sometimes we blow it, sometimes it's misdirected or superficial. 

I have the habit of being awkward and stupid. I always say the wrong thing and fuck it up. For years I used crutches like alcohol or weed to numb my energy.  I am usually a bit too much for people so I thought dulling the edges would bring me down to their level. To be *cool*.  

Back in Boston growing up being who I am, the *cool* girls would say, in between drags of marlboro lights, "You're so fucking weird"  or "you're such a queer" But it would come out "yoah so fuckin' weahd" and "youah such a queeyah." 

That kind of mental and emotional abuse always made me feel inadequate. I wanted to be *cool.*  I couldn't pull off *cool*. Never.  Somewhere along the line I said "fuck these assholes. I am who I am. If you can't handle my energy then find somebody as boring as you are."

We hit Powder Mountain on a blue bird powder day. One of those days that I dream about.  Empty slopes and probably 20 inches of fresh, crystalline snow. I hope and pray she can ride.   

We immediately drop into the backside of the mountain into Powder Country.   No warmup. At Pow Mow as the locals call it, you park at the top and start skiing immediately.  In the trees and steeps and I look back and there she is with this big smile on her face.  She catches up and we are both shaking with excitement. She is a ripper!  

"Oh my god! This is amazing!" We both gushed.  I forgot all about being nervous, about this connection and attraction I was feeling, and just enjoyed the powder.

The whole day went perfectly.  Effortless, like I was with an old friend.  

At the end of the day after we got last chair we wrestled playfully and as we were lying on the ground laughing, right in the middle of the resort with people walking all around us, we kissed for the first time. 

The Universe sighed.
