description: when someone comes into your life that can change your entire
  paradigm, you better listen to the universe

You know that moment when it's darkest before dawn?  When you give up on trying to make things happen and stop trying to swim upstream?  When you hit rock bottom?  For addicts it's the realization that you *can* change.  

*You* have the power in you and the universe is just waiting patiently for you to make the decision.  

I have been trying to shake things up. Getting a haircut by a professional and paying a little bit more than the Super Cuts $20 buzz or the barber.  I go see my friend Raven whom I've known for years.  She is going through her own midlife changes: discovered she is a lesbian and found her soulmate, got yoga certified and her business is doing really well. She is very passionate about her hairstyling.  

I go in every few months and say  "go nuts, just do whatever you think."   And it comes out looking damn good.  Sometimes she colors it, sometimes she will buzz the sides and let the top grow out.  I can't believe as a part time entertainer I got on stage with that boring SuperCuts hair for so long.  I had to shake off the macho bullshit of years of social norms.  I don't care anymore about it. I want a cool hairstyle and she knows her shit. 

I go in on Friday, February 19th. 

For all you astrology buffs out there this day was significant because Feb 19th is when the sun enters Pisces season from Aquarius.  Pisces season is all about surrender and acceptance, and encourages trusting divine intelligence. Also a huge shift from the mind to the heart. It's also a time for closure and culmination. 

I was feeling down:  overwhelmed with life, kinda tired.  She comes out with a sound bowl while her assistant washes my hair.  It vibrates my soul, I go somewhere else in the ether.  

While I am resonating and soaking wet she nonchalantly says, "oh you know what, I have this friend I want you to meet."  

She stops and thinks for a second.

"Oh my God why haven't I thought of this! You two would be perfect together!  She snowboards every day, she is self aware, she is beautiful and smart and kind!"

I am sort of half listening. I have done these set ups before. I think we all have, but I love my friend's energy and don't want to hurt her feelings.  I just went on another boring date a few nights before.  Hopes dashed once again.  She frantically pulls up her Instagram and I see a flash of blonde and a big smile.  

"Ok sure take some pics of me and maybe send it over to her and we will see what happens." I say, and then I put it out of my mind.  Better to placate my lesbian hairdresser with sharp scissors in her hand than to say "No, I'm not looking and not interested right now but thanks."

Note : Always be open. Always be receptive. Always be willing to try something new and say YES. 

Later that day another very pretty blonde starts following me on IG. I see she is friends with Raven and I assume she is my gal.  I stalk her IG and see she's a cheer coach and I don't see any pics of snowboarding or mountain biking and not the person I thought.  I chalk it up to another failed connection by a well-meaning friend playing Cupid.

Two days later I get a message : " Hey Corey! Raven said you were begging for my number"

Whoa, wait what?  This isn't the same person.  

Witty banter ensues. This entity on the other end of my texts is smart and quick and witty and playful.  I find the right person on IG and am instantly attracted.  

The Universe sighs. 

We agree to meet and go snowboarding together.  I plan the tickets and that Sunday I am meeting her for the first time.  A blind date on a mountain together all day. Talk about risking it.  If it sucks we are stuck together.  Live without a net. 

I drink a ton of coffee and buy some bagels.  Despite her beauty and obvious love for her two beautiful kids, her athleticism and self awareness I am still hesitant to open up. I am still pessimistic.  

The Universe sighs again, louder.
