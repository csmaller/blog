The past week I have experienced several scary health "things".  First,  a full on tachycardiac event  (> 200BPM) during a road ride out in the middle of nowhere which forced me to stop and hobble back into town to chug two gatorades just to get my electrolytes back in order.  Top it off with hurting knees, numbness down the right arm and hand, and vertigo and nausea all piling up in the past few weeks.  Needless to say it's freaking me out.  I have been feeling the effects of age.
