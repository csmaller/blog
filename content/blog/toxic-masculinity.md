There are many times in our lives where we have a paradigm shift in our perspective. Whether it's a career you're not passionate about anymore, a lover you have drifted away from, or friendships that don't support or serve you anymore.  

I have  come to one of those crossroads recently, and it is an eight lane super-highway of a crossroads. The biggest and most profound crossroads in my life because many things happened at once.  

For starters, I hate my career. I have been working as a Software Engineer for close to thirteen years. The typical person I work with is what you would expect as a stereotypical Code Bro.  Younger than me by 20 years usually, more concerned with video games and the latest gadgets and judge you by how well your movie trivia is. They rarely take care of their bodies and pride themselves on never leaving their computers and not caring about playing sports or following sports.  Most guys I have worked with bragged about their weekends, where they spent cooped up playing online video games. 

I chose working as an IT Engineer out of fear of not being able to make a living as I got older being a trainer and a teacher.  Computer programmers were and are in high demand.  I jumped at the chance to attend a prestigious school when a personal training client of mine said she would write a letter to the dean to get me in. For a kid from a blue collar family who's entire family tree have never graduated with anything more than an associates degree, the idea of going to Bentley College was a chance you didn't pass up.  No matter if it didn't suit your purpose or even your curiosity.  It had nothing at all to do with my passion.  None.  As a result I have spent almost 20 years doing something I hate. Whether it was greed, our parents vision, or some other necessity, many of us have chosen these soul sucking jobs that we hate for the almighty dollar. 

Once I started paying attention I have also noticed that there are people in my life that I choose to keep around because I feel like I owe them something, or this sense of loyalty to them that was embedded in me from my Massachusetts roots.  These are people, to no fault of their own, I have been friends with for a very long time. We share similar interests like skiing or mountain biking, but other than these activities we don't share much else.  They loved the "old Corey". 

My friends are all good guys. Honest, loyal, good guys. They drink beer,  joke around and rarely show any sort of emotion other than while watching sports, quoting movies or describing a hot girl.  Fashion and artistic expression are not really up their alley.  They must look at me as their sensitive artist musician friend who cares too much about spirituality and connections.   What we would call "a pussy" back in Boston.  Men don't do that in this country. We push it down. We hide behind jokes and talk about superficial shit like sports and argue about politics.

They say, "Where is the Old Corey? The guy who was the life of the party? ready to start a fight with a guy staring at your wrong, being brash and cocky and hitting on anything in a skirt?"  In so many words I have gotten this more than once.  I was raised in a male culture that prized these qualities as "manly".    

To quote Joe Peschi in GoodFellas, "what am I? a clown? Here for your amusement?"

Up until recently my view was : All men were rivals and threats.  All women were objects.
