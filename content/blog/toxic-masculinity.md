title: At A Crossroads
description: standing at a crossroads

There are many times in our lives where we have a paradigm shift in our perspective. Whether it's a career you're not passionate about anymore, a lover you have drifted away from, or friendships that don't support or serve you anymore.  

I have  come to one of those crossroads recently, and it is an eight lane super-highway of a crossroads. The biggest and most profound crossroads in my life because many things happened at once.  

For starters, I hate my career. I have been working as a Software Engineer for close to thirteen years. The typical person I work with is what you would expect as a stereotypical Code Bro.  Younger than me by 20 years usually, more concerned with video games and the latest gadgets and judge you by how well your movie trivia is. They rarely take care of their bodies and pride themselves on never leaving their computers and not caring about playing sports or following sports.  Most guys I have worked with bragged about their weekends, where they spent cooped up playing online video games. 

I chose working as an IT Engineer out of fear of not being able to make a living as I got older being a trainer and a teacher.  Computer programmers were and are in high demand.  I jumped at the chance to attend a prestigious school when a personal training client of mine said she would write a letter to the dean to get me in. For a kid from a blue collar family who's entire family tree have never graduated with anything more than an associates degree, the idea of going to Bentley College was a chance you didn't pass up.  No matter if it didn't suit your purpose or even your curiosity.  It had nothing at all to do with my passion.  None.  As a result I have spent almost 20 years doing something I hate. Whether it was greed, our parents vision, or some other necessity, many of us have chosen these soul sucking jobs that we hate for the almighty dollar. 

Once I started paying attention I have also noticed that there are people in my life that I choose to keep around because I feel like I owe them something, or this sense of loyalty to them that was embedded in me from my Massachusetts roots.  These are people, to no fault of their own, I have been friends with for a very long time. We share similar interests like skiing or mountain biking, but other than these activities we don't share much else.  They loved the "old Corey". 

My friends are all good guys. Honest, loyal, good guys. They drink beer,  joke around and rarely show any sort of emotion other than while watching sports, quoting movies or describing a hot girl.  Fashion and artistic expression are not really up their alley.  They must look at me as their sensitive artist musician friend who cares too much about spirituality and connections.   What we would call "a pussy" back in Boston.  Men don't do that in this country. We push it down. We hide behind jokes and talk about superficial shit like sports and argue about politics.

They say, "Where is the Old Corey? The guy who was the life of the party? ready to start a fight with a guy staring at your wrong, being brash and cocky and hitting on anything in a skirt?"  In so many words I have gotten this more than once.  I was raised in a male culture that prized these qualities as "manly".    

To quote Joe Peschi in GoodFellas, "what am I? a clown? Here for your amusement?"

Up until recently my view was : All men were rivals and threats.  All women were objects.

When I wrote that last sentence I had to stop writing for the day.  I had to take a break from it because  the truth of it really didn't hit me until I actually wrote it.  Then I took a few days and it kept coming back at me.  

I didn't want to admit it.  

The blindside: That glaring, annoying flaw you have you are not aware of.  The blindside is usually discovered as a result of brutal honesty and self reflection.  In our society it's considered rude to point it out and most people do not come right out and tell you about your blindside.  

Was I *really* like that ? It's a bitter pill.  No, I couldn't have been that selfish, right?  I meditated on it.  

### Objects

Now, to clarify, I don't think I "objectified" women in such a stereotypical, cliche, physical way.   Except for my very first relationship (more on this in a second) I didn't just want some barbi doll on my arm. I chose a partner partly because how it would look for me. 

We all do that to a lesser or greater extent tho, right?  How will she make me look?  Will my mom like her?  Will my friends like her? How impressive will she be at parties with her knowledge of whatever?  How does she make me look to everyone else?

This was all subconscious by the way, and has hit me like a ton of bricks.  I chose some for their minds, their athleticism, their kindness, their spirituality and yes their beauty. I fed off of it.  I feel like a predator just writing about it.

The fault of this is of course, I am falling in love with the *idea of this person.*  How can you love them when they grow into something else?  For example, can you still love  them if they gave up skiing and took up knitting when that is what you associate your Self with?

We are all growing, changing, evolving.  Do you appreciate your partner for changing or resent them because you associate your Ego part of the relationship with that *thing* and view that change as some sort of betrayal*?*

It is the result of programming from years of observing my father and other men around me.  He subscribes to the Harley riding bikey attitude of what a woman should be. The guys he rode with has a word for it: A Seat Ornament. As in, you are supposed to sit on the back of the bike and look good and preferably slutty and not say much.  You've seen movies, you know what I am talking about.  

 I watched and learned from this man who would say anything to get with women. He was slick and charming, crass and one dimensional.  Another major influencer on my view of women, my oldest brother, was and is the same way, albeit with a lot more intellect and wit and a lot less boundaries.  I knew nothing else. It was *admirable* to me.  It is how a Real Man is supposed to act and a Real Woman appreciates it.

My stepfather came into my life when I was at my most rebellious. I was 15 years old and already sexually active. I knew it all.  I was angry.  My bio dad was pretty much a "Once A Week Movie And Flea Market Trip" for me. No words of wisdom from him as he sat hung over, checking his watch and possibly still on cocaine watching me eat the free hot dogs we got from my uncle at the restaurant he managed and where my older brother worked.   This was our weekly routine.  

The first time I ever got so drunk that I puked everywhere at a party and blacked out and made out with a friends girlfriend my father picked me up the next day for our weekly ritual and he didn't even notice his teenage son turning into him.  Hungover and proud that I was becoming him.  I bragged about how I threw up all night. He didn't say a word. 

 I was screaming for attention. Begging my father for approval. Daring my step dad to challenge me.  Daring anyone to tell me how to live life. 

The other side of the coin was my stepfather. He has this respect for my mother which i admire and want to emulate but no matter how much positive respectful love I saw from him, the toxic masculinity was deeply ingrained in my subconscious since a very young age.  

I had no shot at a real thing, I felt I didn't really deserve the smart pretty girl in my class so I chose the vapid, vicious blonde barbi doll two years younger than me.  She was skinny and pretty and blonde and one of the meanest people I ever met.  She talked down to me whenever she could. She would call me a 'loser' and a 'fucking goof'  and belittle me in front of our friends in her thick Boston accent. I stayed with her because she was the shell of what I thought i wanted and deserved. I was *lucky* to be with her.  I wasn't going to get any better than this.

She eventually cheated on me with a guy I knew, and then another guy who got her pregnant and that was that. Later I heard she got caught stealing money from the hair salon she worked at in the town we grew up in so, ya know, little victories, big bullets dodged. 

Throughout my 20's, up until I met [Brenda ](https://www.jackalopeadventures.com/blog/the-first-one/)and then later when my second engagement failed and I sort of lost my mind for a while, I went back to my old ways. Discarding any lessons I learned. Giving up. It has taken a divorce, more bad decisions and more hard introspection to see this.

And that is what our society values.  That is part of the toxic masculinity cycle most men in this culture has to deal with.
