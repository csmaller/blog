---
I first came to Utah as a tourist in 2002 with my ex who would go on to be my fiance, then my enemy, then my friend.  She convinced me while have a beer at the Bunyan Room at Loon Mountain in Lincoln, NH that I should change my yearly trip to Colorado to Utah.  

"Is there good skiing there?"

"Um, yeah, the best snow you will ever ski"

hmm, All I knew was the winter olympics were there, Moab was famous for mountain biking, and the Mormons ran shit.  A loud, abrasive cohort at Loon proudly bumped into the conversation: 

"I hear you need to go to Wyoming for beer and there are no bars or nightclubs. Stick with Breckenridge man, at least there is a nightlife. The skiing isn't better there."

Katie, my ex, was a very smart woman. She went to law school at the University of Utah and knew a thing or two about skiing in Utah. I listened to her instead of the drunk friend and two months later we were staying in Bear Hollow in sleepy, shoulder season Park City.  Ironically the same place I bought a condo in almost 20 years later. 

I would love to say I fell in love with Utah immediately but I didn't.  It was early April and Park City was not what it is now.  The whole town was in shoulder season mode.  The Olympics just finished and everyone there was sort of catching their breaths after the event.  I remember it was the same weekend Elizabeth Smart was found after being abducted by a crazy homeless religious zealot.  We drove into Salt Lake City to see the sights, the spectacle of the press conference where this sweet innocent girl was reunited with her family.  

Utah was surreal. Katie broke her arm at Loon and so she couldn't ski with me. She would drop me off at Solitude or Brighton or Snowbird and meet me later.  The whole trip felt weird and Katie, rightfully so, was still pissed that I selfishly downplayed her injury when it happened, but there was something about this weird little state that I found compelling. 

A year later I convinced other friends from Loon to go on vacation with me in Park City. We skied at all the resorts and checked out the town. Park City was still sleepy mid week during the season. Main street was always kind of dead and not much happening. Katie and I were in the middle of one of our numerous break ups (she eventually moved to Deer Valley that year, ahead of me) so I was single and ready to mingle.  With whom I have no idea as there were just no people, never mind single women, to interact with in Park City.  We all figured venturing into Salt Lake was weird and pointless as we (wrongly) thought because the headquarters of the LDS church was in the center of SLC there would be no nightlife.  We drove further when we stayed in Frisco or Silverthorn to Breckenridge but we stayed away from SLC.  Again, we can back after a couple of good powder days but nobody was really gung ho about the place. 

It wasn't until a year later that my friend Curtis and I were watching the weather in the Rockies that I recommended a trip to Utah.  His brother owned a huge mansion that he rented out in Silverthorn that we would take advantage of when nobody was renting it.  We changed our plans and flew into Utah on a Tuesday night.  Because both of us were self employed we could go on these spur of the moment trips.   We rented at a Motel 6 right on 600s in Salt Lake. It was the first trip where something felt different. Just he and I nailed the weather pattern and the next day we were driving our front wheel drive chevy rental up Big Cottonwood intended for Brighton. We couldn't get past Solitude because of the snow so we decided to ride there instead.  Remember, this was before IKON and Epic and Utah was still weird and unknown. There was NO line at all in Big Cottonwood.  We didn't get stopped at the bottom for driving a front wheel drive vehicle with no traction devices. We were arrogant and young and dumb and figured "hey it's not even snowing in the canyon and it's only 14 miles. How bad could it be up there?"

We skied Solitude that day and pretty much lost our minds. We went out to a bar called Port-O-Call in Salt Lake and discovered really hot, really nice Utah women.  We were in heaven.  We both kept saying to each other "why are we not living here??"
