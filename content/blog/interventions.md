Another day another chance

Another way to make your own advance

When tomorrow greets you

another day to cry without

another person to tell your secrets

how he used to beat you

standing here on your own

with your heart so far from home

ain't it hard where theres no reflection?

I'm sorry I kept you locked and away

Isn't that what you want him to say

When he deals with your interventions?

Another night another lie

another girls falls by your side

You think "when will this be done?‚Äù

all the promises and all the pain

you realize you and he are still the same

since this life has begun

Standing here on your own

with your heart so far from home

ain't it hard where theres no reflection?

I'm sorry I kept you locked and away

Isn't that what you want him to say

When he deals with your interventions?



She watches her own hand waving goodbye

Never really saw it or stopped to ask why

So many words you'll never say.

Loneliness is better than dead

Cries of mercy repeat in her head

Realize there's gotta be a better way



Standing here on your own

with your heart so far from home

ain't it hard where theres no reflection?

I'm sorry I kept you locked and away

Isn't that what you want him to say

When he deals with your interventions?
