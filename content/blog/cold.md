\---------------------------

It ain’t like forgiveness Is something I do well

It's not like Im living In a game of show and tell

And you hold me

And yet let me go

Cold

<br/>

You use with you clever ruse

Had me so convinced

We were heading for the sands

The world between our souls

Cold

<br/>\
You let it all go

You let it die slow

You watched me suffering alone

You let us all go

You tried to die slow

You let me suffer here alone.\
<br/>

I try something like forgiveness

It’s callous in it's bliss

A taste I always miss

Something sacred in the pain is so bold

Cold.

<br/>

This distance, I’m healed in an instant

You say you can abide With all the money thrown aside

We Lost that jungle home

Cold
