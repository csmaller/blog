I’m so addicted this affliction

Has got me wishing

Some other man can come along and take my place

Because this race for you is draining

But I’m not complaining

Cos my heart belongs to you

<br/><br/>

It’s so alluring this absurd game

Got my learning words I thought I already knew

But I lt grew inside

this self divide

Got me so conflicted

And im sickened

because my heart belongs to you

<br/><br/>

Did you think I’d fall in line?

Just Pass the time ?

While you figure out your life? 

Did you think I’d play this game at my age ?

I can’t wait another day

Another day

<br/><br/>

I hate to call you selfish because the backlash could lead us to ruin

Or misconstrued my thoughts so i bought myself some rye

And drank myself blind because my heart belongs to you

<br/><br/>

Did you think I’d fall in line?

Just Pass the time ?

While you figure out your life? 

Did you think I’d play this game at my age ?

I can’t wait another day

Another day

<br/><br/>

You’re so demented deep depression

Got me guessing

Which personality will show

To Play the role

Watch me fold my cards

And leave this town

I’m so down because my heart belongs to you

<br/><br/>

Did you think I’d fall in line?

Just Pass the time ?

While you figure out your life? 

Did you think I’d play this game at my age ?

I can’t wait another day

Another day

<br/><br/>

Yet you’re so greedy

I was deceived by your need to be

A girl who pretends to make a stand

Not willing to bend but money

Yeah that money won your heart

I’ve falling apart

Because my heart belongs to you
