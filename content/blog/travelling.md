G C

Travelling long distance for a stranger

Trying to drink you out of my head

Want you in it but oh I love the danger

Want you when I get home again

<br/>

I need you to love me but let me alone

I want you to take me and leave me be

Yeah I could see you in my home

I seem to only need you when I find peace

<br/>
D G

I try and find some place to breathe

I cry to the skies, “just let it be”

I feel like lying down in the rain

Like I'll find some answer to the pain

<br/>
Bridge

C. G

Discontent to leave it at the door

I ran so far and brought me to this place

C G -> em. 

I drank a fifth of whiskey and drove myself blind

D

I tried I tried I tried

<br/>



S0 why did I come so far this way?

Only to be a slave to depression

Ive done so much with positive change

Learned on my own the thrill of deception

<br/>
I try and find someplace To breathe

I cry to the skies , “let it be”

I feel like lying down in the rain

Like ill find some answer to the pain

<br/>

Trained to hide when the heart turns cold

You try to tell me when you want in life

Turned to run when your love gets bold

Around and around I go
<br/>


I try and find someplace To breathe

I cry to the skies , “let it be”

I feel like lying down in the rain

Like I'll find some answer to the pain
