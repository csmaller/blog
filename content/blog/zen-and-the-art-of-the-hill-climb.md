Today was the first day I rode my new road bike.  I just purchased a Specialized S-Works Tarmac carbon.  The bike weighs 15 pounds soaking wet and climbs like a beast.  My old bike: a 2001 Cannondale R-2000 Si was top of the game in 2000. I upgraded the components to the top of the line Campagnolo Record and thought i was a pretty big deal.  Since then alot has changed: I got older, i slowed down, major back surgery too late caused me to lose use of my big toe on my left side which created all types of weird things happening with muscle synchronicity and performance.  I moved to Utah where the climbs are long and painful.
