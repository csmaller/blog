I toss and turn.

She lies next to me, mumbling into the pillow. Everything she is saying to me makes me irritated and angry.  She just wants to know if we are ok. Am I ok?

"Is everything ok with us?  Are you ok?"

I get up. I am short with her: "If you keep asking me this every other day you should just go home. i don't go for this needy , clingy shit!"  

"Babe, why are you being like this?",  she cries.

I storm out of the room.  I go and try to sleep on the couch. She follows me and stares at me with sad eyes. It makes me more upset.

Inside I am raging.  I am so irritated with her. We've been together for a little over a month. We already took a road trip to San Diego and surfed every day.  We've camped in the back of my truck.  I've trusted her to belay me on hard routes when we rock climb.  We have great sex. She loves most of the things I do. She skis and snowboards and is a ski patroller at Park City Mountain.  She loves good music and plays ok guitar.  She checks off all the boxes for me.  She's goofy and kind and tall and blonde and pretty.  So what is my problem?

Welcome to my brain, welcome to my heart, welcome to relationships in the new millennium. 

Everyone I know who is single has ADD.  Everyone is looking for perfection.  Everyone is so fragile and needy and yet have walls up so high.  We all want our needs met but won't budge when it comes to giving.  We go on dating apps, we tell our stories over and over to strangers. We wear our false-hearts on our sleeves to appear sensitive but really we hide the true heart behind barbed wire.  It lies behind angry words and fake emotion and trenches of shallow connections.  

I tell myself I am just out of a hard relationship with someone I thought I loved, or maybe I really did?  I knew her for years and she was recently separated from her husband.  One day after four months of deeper and deeper connections, of talks of moving in together and splitting bills she tells me she is going back to him.  

"For the kids" she says.  

Not for the massive amounts of money she will stand to lose in the divorce:  "For the kids".

I met Stephanie (real name changed) two weeks later.  On the day of my birthday.  I thought i I was ready.  Like a typical guy I always think I am strong enough, healed enough and I am ready to be with someone. 

I have never been a person who snaps at people. Like my mother I am always a pleaser. I am always entertaining and on stage.  

When the trees of negativity have sprouted in my heart and the doubts and fears of being ripped apart again are still fresh in the roots I sally forth with haste.  She is beautiful and fun and 14 years younger than me.  I don't care. I want this. 

I'm not ready but I don't want to lose this.
