I toss and turn.

She lies next to me, mumbling into the pillow. Everything she is saying to me makes me irritated and angry.  She just wants to know if we are ok. 

"Is everything ok with us?  Are you ok?"

I get up. I am short with her: "If you keep asking me this every other day you should just go home. I don't go for this needy , clingy shit!"  

"Babe, why are you being like this?",  she cries, confused.

I storm out of the room.  I go and try to sleep on the couch. She follows me and stares at me with sad eyes. It makes me more upset. I am pissed and I don't really know why.

Inside I am raging.  I am so irritated with her. We've been together for a little over a month.  We already took a road trip to San Diego and surfed every day.  We've camped in the back of my truck.  We rock climb.  We have great sex. She loves most of the things I do. She skis and snowboards and is a ski patroller at Park City Mountain.  She loves good music and plays ok guitar.  She checks off all the boxes for me.  She's goofy and kind and tall and blonde and pretty.  So what is my problem?

Welcome to relationships in the new millennium. 





## ADD

Everyone I know who is single has ADD.  Everyone is looking for perfection.  Everyone is so fragile and needy and yet have walls up so high.  We all want our needs met but won't budge when it comes to giving.  We go on dating apps, we tell our stories over and over to strangers. We wear our false-hearts on our sleeves to appear sensitive but in reality we hide our true hearts behind barbed wire.  It's there behind angry words and fake emotion and trenches of shallow connections.  

I am numb. I don't want to be touched but In my head I yearn for deep, meaningful connections.  I don't want to give anything away or drop the facade of happiness but I want her to open up like a flower in spring. Tell me everything. Let me feed off of you, like a parasite I prey.  I want you to want me, like the Cheap Trick song.  I want you to worship me but don't get too close. Don't expect anything in return.  I am unapproachable and not worthy of real love.   Can't you see how fucked up I am?  I am not the guy you see on stage, or joke around with on a chairlift , or have a beer with in the bar.  I'm kind, but I'm also kinda not.  I'm selfish but I can play it off with words of praise and distractions.  Eye contact and a shoulder to cry on. 



## Doomed

I pick relationships that are doomed to fail: the stripper with all the stereotypical stripper tendencies and addictions(check), the groupie who is 20 years younger than me (check), the Long Distance relationship (check), the narcissist, the emotionally detached, the Disappearing Woman, the Cheater, the Boring-Not-My-Type-But-Looks-Good-On-Paper, the Bisexual, the Polyamorous Wanna-Be-Woke fake ass hipster.  I set it up, I convince myself This Could Be It, then when it ultimately fails I move on quicker than a crack addict picking up a nickel.   I push it all down. Deeper and deeper. Honoring my Italian and Irish heritage of every man in my bloodline, notorious for hiding feelings and not showing any emotion for it is a a sign of weakness. 





## Repetition

I tell myself I am just out of a hard relationship with someone I thought I loved.   I knew her for years and she was recently separated from her husband.  One day after four months of deeper and deeper connections, of talks of moving in together and splitting bills she tells me she is going back to him.  

"For the kids" she says.  

Not for the massive amounts of money she will stand to lose in the divorce:  "For the kids".



I met Stephanie (real name changed) two weeks later.  On the day of my birthday.  I thought i I was ready.  Like a typical guy I always think I am strong enough, healed enough and I am ready to be with someone. 

I have never been a person who snaps at people. Like my mother I am always a pleaser. I am always entertaining and on stage.  

When the trees of negativity have sprouted in my heart and the doubts and fears of being ripped apart again are still fresh in the roots I sally forth with haste.  She is beautiful and fun and 14 years younger than me.  I don't care. I want this. 

I'm not ready but I don't want to lose this.





## Mary in Boulder 

Before all of this I went through a winter of getting over a failed marriage that lasted two weeks. 

Yes. 

You heard right: two weeks.  

I was living in Boulder and I met Mary on a dating app.  We instantly attached ourselves to each other.  A malignant Borderline Personality Disorder with a Fragile Needy Empty Soul.   Two vipers wrapping around each other emotionally like the snakes in  the Caduceus.

We were the same age, we had similar hobbies, she looked great naked.  We did yoga together and walked the dogs. We both loved the Grateful Dead and I would play Althea for her on the guitar and she would correct the lyrics for me. She lived in the hills above Boulder in a cabin. We would watch the bikers below us climbing slowly up Left Hand Canyon and talk about our future.  I never met anyone like her and was instantly hooked.  She knew she had me and so we did what every Gen X'er would do: we bought a real expensive house together and moved in almost immediately.  

In hindsight everything was so wrong and rushed and crazy.  I kept telling myself "When you know, you know". I mean, my step father and mother moved in together almost immediately too and I admire their relationship and their love to this day.  They have been going strong as the head of the family for 35 years and still laugh daily.  I want that. I can have that.  With her. 

On the eve of our one year anniversary of meeting we went to the bar we met at and she proposed to me.  A few weeks later we were married.  We were in the middle of buying a place in Nosara, Costa Rica together.  The dirt roads, the surf, the sand, the locals. It was Heaven.  My dream of leaving the corporate bullshit of software engineering and owning a little coffee shop in the jungle was palpable.   It was going to be our dream home and escape from the insanity and divisiveness of what the US was  going through.   Yoga and surfing and good coffee, we told each other.  It will be amazing. Amazing!

A month later we got married and had a small dinner with friends.  It was heaven. I was so happy.  

"You two look so happy" everyone gushed.  Yet, there was an air of Something Not Right at the dinner table that night that my mother was picking up on.  She recalled later that Mary's friends all looked at me with sort of an air of pity.  Maybe that's not the right word.  They were maybe "concerned" that I didn't know the whole truth.  I was flying high and didn't care.  I had what I wanted.  

Two weeks later it all came crashing down. 

As fate would have it, I lost the job I hated at Large Corporation.  Partly through manifesting it (I really hated the job, the commute and most of my coworkers), partly from backstabbing by an overly ambitious junior programmer who wanted my job.   Either way I knew I would be fine. I did work in IT after all.  I was a senior level developer with tons of experience, even though I hated the business. Boulder was a hot spot for IT and I had offers within days.  

But I digress.  I came home that day and told her I lost my job.  She told me I should go skiing at A-Basin.  

"It will help" , she said.  

"Thanks babe, you really are amazing." I crooned. 

The next day I went skiing alone.  I came home to a dark house as she was out celebrating the sale of her cabin with her friends.  

When you work in Software for Large Corporation, Large Corporation usually gives you a laptop and then takes it away when you leave.  I needed her mac to send out resumes so I logged on to her machine.  

I log in. 

I see her texts from her phone synced to her computer.  I pay it no mind since I am not usually a suspicious person but something caught my eye:  multiple flame emojis from her friend describing a guy Mary met on Sunday night while she was out with her.  

"Whoa, he was hot. a test huh?"

"Yeah he texted me last night"

"I need to be debriefed!"



So, there is my new wife chatting with her friend like two school girls over some guy she has been texting with.  A guy she exchanged phone numbers with two weeks after marrying me.  A random person, I come to find, she met at a sushi restaurant on Pearl Street.  

My heart sank.  My dreams crushed.  The wind taken completely out of my fucking sails.  

I confront her when she comes home.

"We need to talk"  I say.



"Yes, Corey , yes we do" (what the fuck does she have to say to me?)

"So, who is the hot guy you met at sushi sunday night?"  (looks of disbelief.  A rat trapped in a corner.  Eyes darting for a way out. A lie. Something to say. No eye contact made, shoulders stiffened up.)

"oh, huh? he was this *interesting* person. Just, ya know, some guy. He asked for my number. He is very *interesting  ,* just a really *interesting* ya know*?*  He was just walking by and said "hey you look like you're having a great time!"  and I wasn't Corey, I wasn't.  But anyways, he and his friend joined us and he was just so interesting. An ex pro surfer who lives in San Francisco." She stammered.

"um yeah there are lots of ex pro surfers who move to the bay since the surfing is just so amazing at Alcatraz. I want to see these texts between you. Right now, please".

I am numb. I am cold.  

I see her texts after I catch her staring at her phone, possibly looking for some way out. Where is the delete button? How do I delete these messages? How? 

I grab the phone, I see the messages.  

She's flirting with him like she did with me.  On July 3rd she was going to Costa Rica to close on the house and I was supposed to stay in Boulder to watch the dogs.  

"I will see you in CR on July 4th!"  She happily planned.  Clearly an arrangement has been made between the two of them. 

I stare at her in disbelief.

"how? what the fuck? What is this?"

her cold eyes stare down at the floor. The dogs stare at us , knowing not to bark. Knowing something is wrong.

"I wasn't going to follow through with it" was her explanation. 

"I will just sleep on the couch" she finally mutters.  

I am in in disbelief  standing in our mud-room in our beautiful house overlooking Boulder. Watching my new bride still in the Honeymoon Phase of the relationship grabbing pillows and blankets and making her way to the couch. I am stunned. I am numb.  I am furious but I am so tired.  I just want to curl up and die, to scream, to hit her, to run away, to kick her out.  

I do none of these things.  

The next day i get up to leave for Utah  as I was supposed to clean out my condo in Park City that was under contract whose proceeds were going to the Costa Rican house she was planning on fucking a stranger in.  She follows me outside at 5:30 in the morning

"I will pay for the divorce and buy you out of the house. I've caused you enough hearbreak" She says coldly.  

" you fucking bitch!  Who the fuck are you? I don't even know who you are!" I scream at her as she retreats back to the house we purchased together.
