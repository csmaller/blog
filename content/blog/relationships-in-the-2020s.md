## Chapter 1

I toss and turn.

She lies next to me, mumbling into the pillow. Everything she is saying to me makes me irritated and angry.  She just wants to know if we are ok. 

"Is everything ok with us?  Are you ok?"

I get up. I am short with her: "If you keep asking me this every other day you should just go home. I don't go for this needy , clingy shit!"  

"Babe, why are you being like this?",  she cries, confused.

I storm out of the room.  I go and try to sleep on the couch. She follows me and stares at me with sad eyes. It makes me more upset. I am pissed and I don't really know why.

Inside I am raging.  I am so irritated with her. We've been together for a little over a month.  We already took a road trip to San Diego and surfed every day.  We've camped in the back of my truck.  We rock climb.  We have great sex. She loves most of the things I do. She skis and snowboards and is a ski patroller at Park City Mountain.  She loves good music and plays ok guitar.  She checks off all the boxes for me.  She's goofy and kind and tall and blonde and pretty.  So what is my problem?

Welcome to relationships in the new millennium.

## Chapter 2 

Everyone I know who is single has ADD.  Everyone is looking for perfection.  Everyone is so fragile and needy and yet have walls up so high.  We all want our needs met but won't budge when it comes to giving.  We go on dating apps, we tell our stories over and over to strangers. We wear our false-hearts on our sleeves to appear sensitive but in reality we hide our true hearts behind barbed wire.  It's there behind angry words and fake emotion and trenches of shallow connections.  

I am numb. I don't want to be touched but In my head I yearn for deep, meaningful connections.  I don't want to give anything away or drop the facade of happiness but I want her to open up like a flower in spring. Tell me everything. Let me feed off of you, like a parasite I prey.  I want you to want me, like the Cheap Trick song.  I want you to worship me but don't get too close. Don't expect anything in return.  I am unapproachable and not worthy of real love.   Can't you see how fucked up I am?  I am not the guy you see on stage, or joke around with on a chairlift , or have a beer with in the bar.  I'm kind, but I'm also kinda not.  I'm selfish but I can play it off with words of praise and distractions.  Eye contact and a shoulder to cry on.

## Chapter 3

I pick relationships that are doomed to fail: the stripper with all the stereotypical stripper tendencies and addictions(check), the groupie who is 20 years younger than me (check), the Long Distance relationship (check), the narcissist, the emotionally detached, the Disappearing Woman, the Cheater, the Boring-Not-My-Type-But-Looks-Good-On-Paper, the Bisexual, the Polyamorous Wanna-Be-Woke fake ass hipster.  I set it up, I convince myself This Could Be It, then when it ultimately fails I move on quicker than a crack addict picking up a nickel.   I push it all down. Deeper and deeper. I honor my Boston Italian and Irish heritage.  I can almost hear every dead male ancestor cheering from their graves.  No emotion shown! No weakness in the armor!

\-------------

## Chapter 4

I knew Sarah for years and she was recently separated from her husband. She is in phenomenal shape. A person trainer obsessed with fitness, diet, supplements, her body.  We met for coffee and she told me how she cheated on her husband with some rich asshole in Park City and she felt bad because she didn't feel quite so bad about it.  Something inside of me clicks. My brain (or my dick) goes there.  Instead of seeing this gigantic red flag I see possibility.   A month or two later she is separated and living in her own place. She has a party. I go. We drink. We make out. We eventually hook up.  Spiraling down this rusty drain, knowing there is no shot but holding out hope that Love Will Win. I know not-so-deep-down that it's doomed.  A friendship ruined by her need for attention and to feel loved by a man again, and my need to have a fit girlfriend who is great in bed.  But little did we know , it grew.  We really like each other. The humor, the long talks, the bike rides, the early morning workouts, taking edibles and lounging on the couch, and of course the sex. Her friends approved, my friends approved, we had to hide all of it in this little ski town where everyone knows everyone and gossip  spreads faster than Covid-19. 

Ultimately one day after four months of deeper and deeper connections, of talks of moving in together she tells me she is going back to him.  

"For the kids" she says.  

Not for the massive amounts of money she will stand to lose in the divorce. Not for the fact that she would have to work and didn't have much of a career other than being a personal trainer during a pandemic...  "For the kids".

I rail against her.  She owes me nothing. She didn't even consult me about this decision!  Like my opinion mattered.  Nothing stands between a mother and her cubs, I told myself.

 I fire a text at her  "I hope you enjoyed your vacation.  Mark my words: one day you will be in your nice big kitchen staring out the window knowing you had real love and you blew it. You threw happiness away for money in this dead marriage where this guy just talks to you like you're an idiot and an asshole."

But it's too late.  She's gone.  

Later she tries to maintain and repair our friendship via likes on Facebook and making silly little one liners on pictures.  Little flitting waves across the room. I ignore her.  I embrace the Victim Role with open arms.

 Sometimes I am so full of shit.

## Chapter 5

I keep telling myself I just got out of a hard relationship with someone I thought I loved.  I am fucked up because of that.  I am rebounding. I allow myself some sadness  and  a night of hard drinking and self pity.  I need attention from a beautiful woman.  I need to use someone. I need to fill this hole. To duct tape it until it stops breathing. 

I met Stephanie two weeks after.. I saw her picture on social media and made a comment. Something about climbing.  This lead to a very rapid PM conversation and we both agreed we should meet right away...On my birthday.  We drank. I forgot all about Sarah...or Sarah was always there lingering in the background of the conversation.  I have quick daydreams of her finding out I'm out with this much younger, wide-eyed pretty girl and being so jealous.  I drank some more.  

We camped together that weekend. Then we went to San Diego on a whim.

I have never been a person who snaps at people. Like my mother I am always a pleaser. I am always entertaining and on stage.  

When the trees of negativity have sprouted in my heart and the doubts and fears of being ripped apart again are still fresh in the roots I sally forth with haste.  She is beautiful and fun and 14 years younger than me.  I don't care. I want this. 

I'm not ready but I don't want to lose this. I am selfish. I don't care about your needs and wants, really. 

I hope I don't hurt her. She is a good person.  a kind but tough Ohio girl who lost her dad slowly due to a stroke.  She was living her best life. Following her dream but sort of being dragged by the current of life and realizing Ski Patrol doesn't pay the bills and a life living in someones basement is a real possibility.

## Chapter 6

Before all of this I went through a winter of getting over a failed marriage that lasted two weeks. 

Yes. 

You heard right: two weeks.  

I was living in Boulder and I met Mary on a dating app.  We instantly attached ourselves to each other.  Two vipers wrapping around each other emotionally like the snakes in  the Caduceus. A malignant Borderline Personality Disorder meets a Fragile Needy Empty Soul.   A match made in heaven.

![](../assets/caduceaus2.jpg "caduceus")

We were the same age, we had similar hobbies, she looked great naked.  We did yoga together and walked the dogs. We both loved the Grateful Dead and I would play Althea for her on the guitar and she would correct the lyrics for me.  Mary lived in the hills above Boulder in a cabin. We would sit out on her porch and watch the bikers climbing slowly up Left Hand Canyon while drinking coffee and talk about our future.  I never met anyone like her and was instantly hooked.  She followed the Dead and moved to Breckenridge to learn how to snowboard in the 90s.  She had tattoos. She was exotic.  She wanted to learn how to surf and live in Costa Rica.  She knew she had me and so we did what every Gen X'er would do: we bought a real expensive house together and moved in together almost immediately.  

In hindsight everything was so wrong and rushed and crazy.  I kept telling myself "When you know, you know". I mean, my step father and mother moved in together almost immediately too and I admire their relationship and their love to this day.  They have been going strong as the head of the family for 35 years and still laugh daily.  I want that. I can have that.  With her. 

For most of the winter it all went ok. Although she really wasn't as into snowboarding as i was lead to believe.  She had no desire to meet my friends or come to Utah to see me play with my band (I was going back once a month to play gigs in Park City) or ski at all.  She also still did acid with her friends which i found bizarre and hurt my brain to even think about.  I gave up psychedelics after I had a bad trip on mushrooms in college and I sometime think that they affected my brain permanently. I definitely partook in acid and mushrooms alot in college and had my fair share of Dead shows and long walks in the woods tripping on God knows what. 

On the eve of our one year anniversary of meeting we went to the bar we met at and she proposed to me.  A few weeks later we were married.  We had a little dinner with mostly her friends, my parents, and two of my friends.  

"You two look so happy" everyone gushed.  Yet, there was an air of Something Not Right at the dinner table that night that my mother was picking up on.  She recalled later that Mary's friends all looked at me with sort of pity.  Maybe that's not the right word.  They were maybe "concerned" that I didn't know the whole truth.  I was flying high and didn't notice a damn thing. 

At the time we were in the middle of buying a place in Nosara, Costa Rica together.  The dirt roads, the surf, the sand, the yoga, the locals. It was Heaven.  My dream of leaving the corporate bullshit of software engineering and owning a little coffee shop in the jungle was palpable.   It was going to be our dream home and escape from the insanity and divisiveness of  the United States.  Our future would be Pura Vida. 

We were supposed to close on this little Spanish adobe five minutes from the beach on July 3rd of that year.  She was going down to handle the closing of the house and I was staying to take care of the house in Boulder and feed the fur babies. She was going to paint the place and get some furniture and get a company to handle gardening and security etc. This is a very important date to remember, dear reader. July 3rd.

Two weeks later it all came crashing down.

## Chapter 7

That weekend we had a fight and I was getting the cold shoulder. My father (a clinical psychologist for most of my life) explained to me later she was classic BPD and playing the victim and abandonment issues where par for the course.   

I do realize now how she surrounded herself with people who were givers. Her friends mostly doted on her and she played the role of victim with them very well. I recall her needing to take a sled down at Breckenridge because she had an "asthma attack" despite two doctors telling her she didn't have asthma. Who takes the sled down for an asthma attack anyways?  I digress. 

The reason for this Cold Shoulder was after her usual 1.5 hour power hot yoga class she had another "asthma" attack and wanted me to come and get her at yoga. Despite having a car and an inhaler and a place to rest and me being home about 45 minutes away, she insisted I come and get her. I had trouble hearing her as she told me this as I was speaking to her while driving up Lee Hill Road.  

Now, anyone who knows Boulder, CO and Lee Hill Road knows it's a very steep,  beautiful, well known road for road cycling but you instantly lose service when you turn onto the road.  

"what babe? hold on? Shit, I JUST got up Lee Hill Rd, I was waiting for you in Boulder if you wanted to have a beer or something after yoga. What? Shit, I cannot hear you, let me call you back when i get home and into service"

Five minutes later I call and she says, quite coldly, the she is *fine*. Everything is *fine*.  Her friend Dana is there and they are going out for drinks. She is there for her, Corey, and everything is *fine.* 

Mary didn't come home till late that night and had beers with her friend. Oh,  and two guys from yoga who just happened to show up at the same bar.

Oh and that the guys they happen to meet at the bar was so *interesting*  and he was there for me, Corey.  He was there for me.  He checked on me when I had trouble breathing at yoga and checked my pulse and told me I should probably have a beer with him because it will help the asthma. 

Cracks in the foundation.  Red flags popping up in my head.  I don't care. We just got married. This is what i want. Why is she saying these things? Why is she doing this?

Even the dogs looked at me like I was getting played the fool.

As fate would have it, I lost the job I hated at Large Corporation that Monday.  Partly through manifestation: I really hated the job, the commute and most of my coworkers, partly from backstabbing by an overly ambitious junior programmer who wanted my job.   Either way I knew I would be fine. I did work in IT after all.  I was a senior level developer with tons of experience, even though I hated the business. Boulder was a hot spot for IT and I had offers within days.  

I came home that day and told her I lost my job.  She told me I should go skiing at A-Basin.  

"It will help" , she said.  

"Thanks babe, you really are amazing." I crooned. Forgetting the frigid woman I was dealing with all weekend.

The next day I went skiing alone.  I came home to a dark house as she was out celebrating the sale of her cabin with her friends.  

Side note: When you work in Software for A Large Corporation, that Large Corporation usually gives you a laptop and then takes it away when you leave. Since I didn't have a computer I needed her mac to send out resumes so I logged on to her machine.  

I log in. 

I see her texts from her phone synced to her computer.  I pay it no mind since I am not usually a suspicious person but something caught my eye:  multiple flame emojis from her friend describing a guy Mary met on Sunday night while she was out with her.  

"Whoa, he was hot. a test huh?"

"Yeah he texted me last night!  Oofda"

"I need to be debriefed!"

I can't, I'm so MAD at Corey right now"

"ohh, I need to be debriefed"

That was the exact exchange as I recall it.  Her single friend I took to calling Eeyore because she was always down about not finding the right man, using the term "debriefed"  like it's some kind of military situation: A Game. A War.

And here is my brand new wife chatting with her friend like two school girls over some guy she has been texting with.  A guy she exchanged phone numbers with two weeks after marrying me.  A random person, I come to find, she met at a sushi restaurant on Pearl Street.  

My heart sank.  My dreams crushed.  The wind taken completely out of my fucking sails.  The reality of it all is tumbling down.  The veil is being ripped off.

## \------------

## Chapter 8

I confront her when she comes home.

"We need to talk"  I say.

"Yes, Corey , yes we do" 



I think, "what the fuck does she have to say to me?"

"So, who is the hot guy you met at sushi Sunday night? Was it the dude from Yoga? Mr Sensitive Ponytail Boy whom you found so *interesting* and was *there for you* for beers Friday night*?*"  

Thoughts of me committing assault at our yoga studio on some dude flashed through my mind.  

She is stunned. Looks of disbelief.  A rat trapped in a corner.  Eyes darting for a way out. A lie. Something to say. No eye contact made, shoulders stiffened up. She did not know that I knew. 

"oh, huh? No, no baby. Not him. No. It was...this other guy. He was just walking by and said "hey you look like you're having a great time!"  and I wasn't Corey, I wasn't.  But anyways, he and his friend joined us and he was just so *interesting*. He's an ex pro surfer who lives in San Francisco."

"um yeah there are lots of ex pro surfers who move to the Bay Area since the surfing is just so amazing at Alcatraz."

"Anyways, he asked for my number after " She stammered.

"Did you tell him you are married and maybe you shouldn't give out your number? I want to see these texts between you. Right now, please".

I am numb. I am cold.  

I see her texts after I catch her staring at her phone, possibly looking for some way out. 

Where is the delete button? How do I delete these messages? How? 

I grab the phone, I see the messages.  She is the instigator of the conversation, not he.  

"Hey it's Mary from (sushi emoji)"

"Oh i wouldnt have known it was you if it wasnt for the sushi emoji!  I had such a great time. I almost missed my flight and would have had to stay at your place"

Ah, the single guy bringing sleeping arrangements into the conversation. An old trick I have used many times.  Like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park testing the electric fence, except he was looking for a way in, not out.  

"oh thats ok i have extra beds "

"I" not "We".

She's flirting with him like she did with me when we met. The conversation continues. She stands in the kitchen, arms folded, staring at the floor. Hands caught in the cookie jar. 

"Oh, that's OK I will see you in Costa Rica on July 4th!"  She happily planned.  Clearly an arrangement has been made between the two of them. 

I stare at her in disbelief.

"How? what the fuck? What is this?"

her cold eyes stare down at the floor. The dogs stare at us , knowing not to bark. Knowing something is wrong.

"I wasn't going to follow through with it" was her explanation.  That's it.

When bank robbers get caught with plans to rob the bank, and a date they will do it, and conversation between them, all they really need to say is "i wasn't planning on following through with it." Classic defense. Works every time.  

We have two airBnB renters in the basement.  I am furious. I want to scream at her and call her horrible names but I hold back, fearing the dreaded AirBnB review I would get.  So I am whispering directly about two inches from her face.

"What the fuck did you think was going to happen, Mary? huh?? What the fuck??"

"I will just sleep on the couch" she finally mutters.  Ignoring my increasingly frantic questioning. 

I am in in disbelief  standing in our mud-room in our beautiful house overlooking Boulder. Watching my new bride still in the Honeymoon Phase of the relationship grabbing pillows and blankets and making her way to the couch. I am stunned. I am numb.  I am furious but I am so tired.  I just want to curl up and die, to scream, to hit her, to run away, to kick her out.  

I do none of these things.  

I go to our new bed we just got and try to sleep.  I stare at the ceiling and eventually fade away.

## Chapter 9

The next day i get up to leave for Utah  as I was supposed to clean out my condo in Park City that was under contract whose proceeds were going to the Costa Rican house she was planning on fucking a stranger in.  She follows me outside at 5:30 in the morning

"I will pay for the divorce and buy you out of the house. I've caused you enough hearbreak" She says coldly.  Flatly. No emotion.

She turns on her heels and runs back up the big flagstone stairs back to the house two at a time. 

" you fucking bitch!  Who the fuck are you? I don't even know who you are!" I scream at her as she retreats back to the house we purchased together.
