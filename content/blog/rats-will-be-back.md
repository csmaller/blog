this damn corona has really killed the music scene all the world over.  It's gonna take a while for us to get back to 100%. meantime I will still be doing a few socially distant acoustic shows at the Spur in Park City:

* July  18th: Upstairs 6-9pm
* August 8th : Back Bar 7-10pm
* August 15th: Upstairs 6-9pm
