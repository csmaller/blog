It has taken some time to come around and start actually writing about this.  We went through such trauma together and I have, for years, pushed it all down into the subconscious. 

Brenda (name changed) and I first met in Boston at a Spinning studio we both managed in Downtown Crossing right in the heart of the city.  It was the late 90's and Spinning was taking off as the new, hot workout.  I just gave up management as I had moved to the suburbs and took a job at a Golds Gym doing sales and away from the pain of the commute into town every day.  A friend came into the gym and told me I needed to come back to the Spin Studio. 

"Everyone misses you and your energy! Plus there is a new manager there who is really taking the studio in a good direction. You have to meet her."

A week later I strolled back into the Studio and met Brenda.  

"Oh are you the famous Corey?"  she said in a scratchy higher pitched voice.  The kind of voice that you would imagine Sandy Duncan would have if she smoked a pack of marlboros a day.  

I was taken aback.  She was beautiful. Blonde curls, no makeup, very fit, very outgoing, very friendly and the most beautiful smile. 

"um, er, yeah. Hi."

She jumps in immediately, "When can you start working here again?  I will give you your old time slot back and to make it worth your while we are starting personal training in the extra space and you could pick up some clients after your class."

I think at the time she was right in the middle of training someone. She was all business. High energy. Direct. Confident. To the point. She knew she would get me back in the gym.  I never met anyone like her. 

I somehow managed to make it work. I would drive into Southie, park somewhere near Broadway, walk a half mile to the green line, catch it to Downtown Crossing, walk to the studio, teach a noon class, maybe train someone and most importantly have lunch with Brenda at the salad bar downstairs. It was a time that seems so carefree now, twenty years later.  

She just broke it off with a long time boyfriend and moved into an apartment with a Berkley School of Music friend on Harvard Ave across town in Coolidge Corner.  

I was just amazed by her. She was a Yale graduate, smart, kind, witty and would flirt and poke fun at my accent and world view. She did Ironman triathalons and would crush all the pros out of the water, but her bike sucked and her run was fast, so she would gain ground, lose ground and then have to maintain her place on the run.  She had potential to be great if she could improve her bike efficiency.  She would look at me as I spoke and really listened to what I was saying. 

To anyone who have seen Goodwill Hunting you know there are two distinct classes in Boston: The Haves and Have-Nots, the Blue Collars and the White Collars, the Harvard Elites and the Trade School Sullys.  I was raised mostly by my single mother from Dorchester who had to bartend to make ends meet.  My father was an MBTA bus driver also from Dorchester.  We were firmly in the Blue Collar mindset.  Dropping our R's and "ings", saying "fuck" with ever sentence.  Calling everyone "kid" or "sweetheart".  Then here comes Brenda from Wellesley. From The Other Side.
