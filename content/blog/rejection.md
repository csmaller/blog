"Man , I had so much fun with you last night. Thanks again for the amazing time.  Let's do it again!"

Then...Nothing.  

Dating in the 20's:You go out with someone you met on a dating app or facebook.  They are all intimate. They tell you secrets and why they are single, past loves who have jilted them and why they are the victim and not the victor. You get a kiss at the end of the night and go home on air.

You think you've connected.  You think you made headway into someone's heart.  Maybe even a deeper feeling than that.  Then, the next day once the alcohol wears off they disappear.  

You start to get a bit depressed. You stalk their instagram and wonder what you did wrong.  

Was I too aggressive? Not aggressive enough? Not tall enough? Fit enough? Smart enough? Drove the wrong car? Didn't make enough money?

We've all done it right?  We've all been the Rejected and the Rejector.  You don't feel like you owe that person an explanation. I mean, you just met and he just bought you some drinks or dinner.  No need to be brutally honest and rip the band aid off.  No, it's better to not hurt their feelings.  Do the "Slow Fade".  Tell them you need to work late all week and hopefully they get the hint.  If they don't then turn it on them:

"Hey what's up? I am getting the sense you aren't interested even though we talked all night and made out in my car.  I thought we had a connection?"

"Whoa. Really? Dude, I have been busy!  (insert undefendable excuse here to make you feel like the asshole.  Topics include: My Son Was Sick. My Dog Was Sick.  I Was Sick.  I Was Working.  I Was Out Of Service Even Though I Was Updating Social Media).  I don't need this in my life."

See? Now you are the asshole and they can move on knowing they are good people.  You have become part of the narrative of their next date.  You get a title and a nickname for their friends.

That's ok.  Pick yourself up and dust yourself off.  You have other fish in the sea.  You have a line of men or women waiting to take you out.  It's no problem to stay shallow and date in this world. Even during a pandemic. If you look good you will get dates. Period.  There is no need for intellect or empathy.  

Swipe right. Connect. Disappear. Repeat.
