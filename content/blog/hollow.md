Words whisper summer rain

Dropped outside your windowpane

Painted pictures these memories

Fade between the tapestries

of life and what you thought was real

what we see and what we feel

are chemicals blatant lies

\

Will you send me a sign

show me its alright

Drop me a line

Tell me I pray

You said many times your soul is hollow

But you saved the world for me

so I cant throw it all away

\---

Fragile creature made of glass

Burned of clay , sand and ash

Ponder monkey, go make your name

Our history shall do the same

\
---

Written of our fallen lives

Victory shall seize the skies

Your destruction will never change

perverting earth to make your claim
