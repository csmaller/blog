I don’t know what the world may bring

But if it helps you I can sing this song for you

And help you find your way back home

<br/>

So I can hold your face in my hands

And kiss your neck, smell your skin

And pull you into my world and my soul

We can lose control and forget about all this trouble

For a while

<br/>

It sure is good to see you

girl, its been too long

The baby’s grown and what they’ve done to you was so wrong

\
<br/>

They told me “don’t give in to the sorrow”

But they’ve never looked inside

Its easy to do when your lied to

And you can turn your eyes blind to the face behind the mask

Behind the views

Behind the news

Behind the bloodshot eyes of the man who couldn’t give a damn

About you and me and all of our worthless lives

<br/>

It sure is good to see you

girl, its been too long

The baby’s grown and what they’ve done to you was so wrong

\
<br/>

The tears never stopped flowing

And she threw her veil to the ground

I can still remember her face

I can still remember the sound of her cries

When she fell and stared up to the sky

Screaming “ Why can’t you take me, instead of my boy

Instead of my boy

Instead of my boy”

\
<br/>

It sure is good to see you

girl, its been too long

The baby’s grown and what they’ve done to you was so wrong
